1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,560
when a farmer in new south wales

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,560
australia discovered a large black

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,319
object sticking out of the ground in a

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,320
remote part of his land he thought it

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,519
was a tree

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,679
but this turned out to be a piece of

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,240
space junk which had fallen from the sky

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
the australian space agency later said

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
it came from a spacex capsule dr brad

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
tucker is an astrophysicist at the

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
australian national university and he

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
was called to examine the object

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,599
a lot of people often think they find

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
space chunk of meteorites and it's

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
always exciting to hear but

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
usually easy to determine it's not in

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
something more earthly but in this case

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
when we got the call we also knew this

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
that previously a couple weeks prior the

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,559
trunk of the spacex crew one capsule had

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,280
re-entered over the area in australia

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
and at that time lots of people saw it

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
breaking apart they heard sonic booms

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
and the place the farmers were calling

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
from was smack underneath that path so i

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
was like hey this actually may be junk

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,480
and then when i saw the photos

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,640
you clearly saw that there was something

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
weird about this so it was an exciting

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
call to some degree to go and hop in in

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
the car and drive relatively nearby a

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,760
few hours uh to go investigate and

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
confirm that this was indeed space junk

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
from the spacex crew one uh trunk

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,960
capsule usually when we have reports of

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
space junk it's hard to figure out the

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,720
source because there could be so many

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
different things in this case because

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
that part was so well cataloged and it

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
was so well observed entering the

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
atmosphere and fragmenting and breaking

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
apart we kind of knew that this had

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
happened and once we were able to get

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
the location and then obviously go there

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
firstly it was making sure well how

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
exactly close is this bought to that

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
flight path and it was within you know a

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,399
few kilometers which is as good as you

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,280
get

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,040
you can also then see subtleties in the

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,799
way it's made so in fact we are looking

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,200
at the scorching patterns as this junk

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
hits the earth's atmosphere it breaks

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,360
apart but due to the massive friction of

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,240
the atmosphere causes bits of it to burn

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
and essentially incinerate which you can

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
see you can then also see the materials

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
that it was made up of uh to confirm you

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
know this indeed is high-tech

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
manufacturing and not

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
farm equipment laying down so to speak

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
and the benefit here which was the final

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
part was there's part numbers on it very

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,360
rarely do you get the part numbers

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
labeled

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
and this allowed us to uh

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
confidently say it was from this and

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
actually then reach out to spacex who

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
then also confirmed that it was indeed

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,599
theirs
